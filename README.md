# todolist

This project is a simple in-construction todolist app.
I'm trying to follow Doman-Driven Design principles
but in a functional way, inspired by [Pierre Criulanscy's great article](https://medium.com/spotlight-on-javascript/domain-driven-design-for-javascript-developers-9fc3f681931a).

The client part is a Vue project which I've made with the help of
[Brad Traversy's Vue.js tutorial on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j55fHUJqtyw).

## Installing dependencies

in the root folder, run:
```
npm install
```

Then go to client folder (which is a separate project) and run the same command again:
```
cd client
npm install
```

## Running the application

At the root folder, run the server:

### standard run

```
npm start
```

### development run

```
npm run dev
```

### Running tests

There are a couple of basic unit tests. You can run them like this:

```
npm test
```
